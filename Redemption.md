# Redemption Project

### Welcome to my redemption project

The reason why I lost mark on Project 1 was because I didn't use enough comments. So:
- I'm gonna use *more* comments
- I'm gonna **redeem** my lost marks
- That's it!!

What do I plan to change?
1. Use more comments on my Rmd and R files
2. Be more creative
